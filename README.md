# simple-discord-bot
  This was my first attempt at making a discord bot
  
  This is <strong>very</strong> outdated
  
  Made to be hosted in [Heroku](https://heroku.com)
  
  
## Stuff used
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/)
  
The prefix is ðŸ‘Œ (change it in `config.json`)

use the command `help` for a list of all commands.
